Creation stories often depict the birth of land and people, emphasizing the essentialness of land to tribal identity. Trickster tales are represented as animal figures who transgress social norms and function as culture heroes that reinforce social boundaries through their mishaps and experiences. These stories differ from European accounts of creation and representation of human and animal relationships. They suggest parallel development, European influence, and a strong emphasis on tribal identity and social codes.',\n",

It explains that Native American creation stories and trickster tales challenge the European view of animals as inferior to humans, and instead advocate for a sense of equality with nature. Additionally, the article offers insight into how Native Americans interpreted first contact with European explorers, highlighting their customary social practices and the explorers' disingenuous reliance on Native American help while appropriating land and introducing European commodities into Native American culture.

England had the largest and most lasting colonial reach, starting with their first permanent settlement in Jamestown and expanding along the eastern seaboard. The relationship between imperialism and the spread of religion in the new world was first cemented during Spanish exploration.',\n",

The motivations behind these expeditions varied, with some seeking to convert natives to Christianity while others prioritized trade and survival. The accounts of these expeditions served as written records for the governments and organizations that funded them, as well as tales of adventure and exotic lands to entice more investment and emigration. The following section highlights the perspectives of six Native American tribes whose territories spanned the eastern seaboard, midwest, and southwest regions of the United States.

It covers the various motives and ideologies of different groups, including the Puritans, and the impacts of the expansion of English colonies on Native American tribes. It also delves into the growth of African slavery, the significance of Puritanism, and the aesthetic elements of Puritan literature. The chapter concludes with an overview of different colonies, such as Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.',\n",
       " 'This passage provides an overview of the early history of the English colonies in North America. It discusses conflicts with Native American tribes, the growth of African slavery, and the dominance of the Puritans in the colonies. The Puritans were a group who sought to reform the Church of England, and their beliefs and culture had a significant impact on the colonies. The passage highlights the persistence of debates about slavery and freedom that would continue to shape American history for centuries to come.',\n",
       " 'The Puritans came to the New World with the goal of building a community constructed around religious principles. They subscribed to Calvinist theology, which held that mankind was born depraved as a result of original sin and incapable of achieving salvation on their own. According to Calvinism, only God’s intervention could save people from damnation. Some of the faithful will be saved because of unconditional election. Puritans were instructed to develop an attitude of indifference toward material things and personal relationships and emphasize the weaning of affections from the things of this world. They looked outside of themselves for guidance in following God’s will, with the Bible being the first source of guidance.',\n",
       " \"The Puritans believed in a typological relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament, where stories of the Old Testament foreshadowed the antitypes or “the very image of the good things” in the New Testament, which communicated God’s will. Despite trying to keep their theological borders, the Puritans' power eventually faded due to a declining membership in the church. They adopted the Half-Way Covenant in 1662 to increase their ranks and hold on to political power, but their cultural influence continues to impact American culture. The Puritan aesthetic of plain style, characterized by simplicity and accessibility, is evident in many of their works.\",\n",

The book recounts the history of the pilgrims who left England to escape persecution by the Church of England and landed at Plymouth in 1620. Bradford recorded the pilgrims' struggles with starvation and sickness, as well as their interactions with Native Americans. He also wrote about the democratic principles that were put into practice in Plymouth and the Puritan ethic in action. The book offers simple yet monumental truths of the pilgrim's lives and serves as testimony of God's designs.\"]"

The literature review highlights scalability, security, and user adoption as key issues in this area. The study suggests that blockchain technology can offer significant benefits in the management of student data and credentials, administration activities, and teaching and learning in schools and universities. The research is multidisciplinary, covering various fields such as science and technology, medicine, marketing, and law. However, the number of publications is limited, and there is a need for further exploration of the area, especially in areas such as social sciences, business, and management education. Most of the existing studies are qualitative and review-based, and there is a lack of quantitative research on the overall impact of blockchain technology on education.'],\n",
       " ['This chapter covers pre- and early colonial literature, with a focus on Native American tales and their cultural significance. It explores the key features of Native American stories, and how they differ from European stories. The chapter also discusses the role of religion in European settlement, and how European accounts of their exploration were influenced by their intended audience and purpose. Ultimately, the chapter emphasizes the performative and oral nature of Native American tales, stressing that their significance cannot be fully grasped through words alone.',\n",
       "  'The Native American creation and trickster stories serve both an explanatory and guiding function about the world and social codes. Creation stories often depict the birth of land and people, emphasizing the essentialness of land to tribal identity. Trickster tales are represented as animal figures who transgress social norms and function as culture heroes that reinforce social boundaries through their mishaps and experiences. These stories differ from European accounts of creation and representation of human and animal relationships. They suggest parallel development, European influence, and a strong emphasis on tribal identity and social codes.',\n",
       "  \"The article discusses the Native American perspective on European exploration and colonization of the Americas. It explains that Native American creation stories and trickster tales challenge the European view of animals as inferior to humans, and instead advocate for a sense of equality with nature. Additionally, the article offers insight into how Native Americans interpreted first contact with European explorers, highlighting their customary social practices and the explorers' disingenuous reliance on Native American help while appropriating land and introducing European commodities into Native American culture. Finally, the article provides some background on Spain's exploration of the Americas and their search for a westward passage to Asia.\",\n",
       "  'The European powers, including Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, and England, sought new trade routes and territory in the Americas for commodities such as precious metals, fur, timber, and agricultural products, as well as an extension of their empires. Spain primarily explored South and Central America and the southeastern and southwestern parts of North America, while other European countries concentrated in different areas. England had the largest and most lasting colonial reach, starting with their first permanent settlement in Jamestown and expanding along the eastern seaboard. The relationship between imperialism and the spread of religion in the new world was first cemented during Spanish exploration.',\n",
       "  'The passage discusses the exploration and colonization of North America by European powers, primarily focusing on the Spanish, French, Dutch, and English. The motivations behind these expeditions varied, with some seeking to convert natives to Christianity while others prioritized trade and survival. The accounts of these expeditions served as written records for the governments and organizations that funded them, as well as tales of adventure and exotic lands to entice more investment and emigration. The following section highlights the perspectives of six Native American tribes whose territories spanned the eastern seaboard, midwest, and southwest regions of the United States. These excerpts provide insights into the varied cultures, traditions, and histories of these indigenous peoples.'],\n",
       " ['This chapter explores the reasons behind European settlements in North America during the seventeenth century, particularly among the English. It covers the various motives and ideologies of different groups, including the Puritans, and the impacts of the expansion of English colonies on Native American tribes. It also delves into the growth of African slavery, the significance of Puritanism, and the aesthetic elements of Puritan literature. The chapter concludes with an overview of different colonies, such as Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.',\n",
       "  'This passage provides an overview of the early history of the English colonies in North America. It discusses conflicts with Native American tribes, the growth of African slavery, and the dominance of the Puritans in the colonies. The Puritans were a group who sought to reform the Church of England, and their beliefs and culture had a significant impact on the colonies. The passage highlights the persistence of debates about slavery and freedom that would continue to shape American history for centuries to come.',\n",
       "  'The Puritans came to the New World with the goal of building a community constructed around religious principles. They subscribed to Calvinist theology, which held that mankind was born depraved as a result of original sin and incapable of achieving salvation on their own. According to Calvinism, only God’s intervention could save people from damnation. Some of the faithful will be saved because of unconditional election. Puritans were instructed to develop an attitude of indifference toward material things and personal relationships and emphasize the weaning of affections from the things of this world. They looked outside of themselves for guidance in following God’s will, with the Bible being the first source of guidance.',\n",
       "  \"The Puritans believed in a typological relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament, where stories of the Old Testament foreshadowed the antitypes or “the very image of the good things” in the New Testament, which communicated God’s will. Despite trying to keep their theological borders, the Puritans' power eventually faded due to a declining membership in the church. They adopted the Half-Way Covenant in 1662 to increase their ranks and hold on to political power, but their cultural influence continues to impact American culture. The Puritan aesthetic of plain style, characterized by simplicity and accessibility, is evident in many of their works.\",\n",
       "  \"Of Plymouth Plantation is a chronicle written by William Bradford, a Puritan leader and governor of Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. The book recounts the history of the pilgrims who left England to escape persecution by the Church of England and landed at Plymouth in 1620. Bradford recorded the pilgrims' struggles with starvation and sickness, as well as their interactions with Native Americans. He also wrote about the democratic principles that were put into practice in Plymouth and the Puritan ethic in action. The book offers simple yet monumental truths of the pilgrim's lives and serves as testimony of God's designs.\"]]"
